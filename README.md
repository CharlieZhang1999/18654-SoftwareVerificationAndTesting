## Description
This is my repo for learning Software Verficiation and Testing principles. Here, I played with several practices covering VT principles, systematic testing, input space analysis, and test coverage; civering practical strategies such as test-driven development, unit testing, and test design; covering formal approaches such as abstraction, model checking, static analysis, and symbolic execution. This is only for my use and any other unauthorized use is not permitted.
